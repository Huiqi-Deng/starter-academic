I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the CSE department of Texas A&M University. My advisor is Dr. Xia Hu.  My research is on interpretable machine learning, with a particular interest in the areas of DNN interpretability. I am also interested in areas of fairness in deep learning, adversarial detection, fake news detection, and medical diagnosis.
